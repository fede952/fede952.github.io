It's 4:55 PM on a Friday and someone just merged to main. The CI/CD pipeline is running. There's no stopping it now.

You are a **Junior Dev** trying to survive the deploy. Dodge the bugs, errors, and fires. Grab coffee for a speed boost and StackOverflow for a shield. How long can you keep production alive?
