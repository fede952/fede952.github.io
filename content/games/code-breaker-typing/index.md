The target system is locked behind an encrypted firewall. Your only way in? **Type the exact code sequence before time runs out.** One mistake and you're locked out. How fast are your fingers?

## How to Play

- **Click "INITIALIZE HACK"** to start the timer and reveal a code snippet.
- **Type the snippet exactly** as shown — every character, space, and symbol matters.
- **Beat the 30-second clock** to breach the system.
- If time runs out, the connection is terminated. Hit **RETRY HACK** to try again.
