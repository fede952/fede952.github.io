## System Init

Linux file permissions are the first line of defense in any system. A misconfigured permission can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, or lock out legitimate services from the files they need. Beyond permissions, managing users, groups, services, and processes is the daily bread of any system administrator. This field manual covers the commands you will use every day — from setting the correct permissions on a web server's document root to killing a runaway process that is consuming all available memory. Every command is explained with practical examples for real-world scenarios.

These commands require root or sudo access for most operations. Execute with care.

## File Permissions

Linux uses a three-tier permission model: **Owner**, **Group**, and **Others**. Each tier can have **Read (r=4)**, **Write (w=2)**, and **Execute (x=1)** permissions. Understanding this model — and the numeric (octal) notation that represents it — is essential for securing files, directories, scripts, and application data. Misconfigured permissions are one of the most common security vulnerabilities in production servers.

### Understanding permission notation

```bash
# Permission structure: [type][owner][group][others]
# Example: -rwxr-xr-- means:
#   - : regular file (d for directory)
#   rwx : owner can read, write, execute (4+2+1 = 7)
#   r-x : group can read and execute (4+0+1 = 5)
#   r-- : others can only read (4+0+0 = 4)
# Numeric notation: 754

# View permissions for files in a directory
ls -la /var/www/

# View permissions for a specific file
ls -l /etc/passwd
```

### chmod — Change file permissions

```bash
# Set permissions using numeric (octal) notation
chmod 755 script.sh        # rwxr-xr-x (owner: full, group/others: read+execute)
chmod 644 config.yaml      # rw-r--r-- (owner: read+write, group/others: read)
chmod 600 id_rsa           # rw------- (owner only: read+write — SSH private keys)
chmod 700 /root            # rwx------ (owner only: full access)
chmod 777 /tmp/shared      # rwxrwxrwx (everyone: full access — avoid in production)

# Set permissions using symbolic notation
chmod u+x script.sh        # Add execute permission for owner
chmod g-w config.yaml      # Remove write permission for group
chmod o-rwx secret.key     # Remove all permissions for others
chmod a+r public.html      # Add read permission for all (a = all)

# Apply permissions recursively to a directory
chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/

# Set the setuid bit (run as file owner)
chmod u+s /usr/bin/myapp

# Set the setgid bit (new files inherit group)
chmod g+s /shared/team/

# Set the sticky bit (only owner can delete their files)
chmod +t /tmp/
```

### chown — Change file ownership

```bash
# Change owner of a file
chown www-data index.html

# Change owner and group
chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/

# Change only the group
chown :developers project/

# Change ownership recursively
chown -R deploy:deploy /opt/myapp/

# View current ownership
ls -la /var/www/
```

### Special permissions reference

```bash
# Common permission patterns for production:
# 755 — Directories, executable scripts
# 644 — Configuration files, static content
# 600 — Private keys, credentials, .env files
# 700 — Home directories, sensitive scripts
# 775 — Shared directories (with setgid for group)
# 440 — Sudoers files (/etc/sudoers.d/)

# Find files with insecure permissions (world-writable)
find / -perm -o+w -type f 2>/dev/null

# Find all SUID binaries (security audit)
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null

# Find all SGID binaries
find / -perm -2000 -type f 2>/dev/null
```

## User Management

User and group management controls who can access the system and what they can do. Every process runs as a user, every file is owned by a user, and access control is enforced based on user identity. Properly managing users — creating them with minimal privileges, assigning them to appropriate groups, and disabling them when no longer needed — is fundamental to system security.

### Create and manage users

```bash
# Create a new user with a home directory
useradd -m -s /bin/bash newuser

# Create a user with a specific UID and group
useradd -m -u 1001 -g developers -s /bin/bash deploy

# Set or change a user's password
passwd newuser

# Modify user properties (change shell)
usermod -s /bin/zsh existinguser

# Add a user to a supplementary group (without removing existing groups)
usermod -aG sudo newuser
usermod -aG docker deploy

# Lock a user account (disable login)
usermod -L compromised-user

# Unlock a user account
usermod -U restored-user

# Delete a user (keep home directory)
userdel olduser

# Delete a user and their home directory
userdel -r olduser
```

### Manage groups

```bash
# Create a new group
groupadd developers

# Add a user to a group
gpasswd -a newuser developers

# Remove a user from a group
gpasswd -d newuser developers

# List all groups a user belongs to
groups newuser

# List all groups on the system
cat /etc/group

# Delete a group
groupdel old-group
```

### Sudo configuration

```bash
# Edit the sudoers file safely
visudo

# Grant a user full sudo access (add to sudoers)
echo "deploy ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/deploy

# Grant a user sudo for specific commands only
echo "backup ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/rsync, /usr/bin/tar" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/backup

# Check current sudo privileges
sudo -l

# View who is currently logged in
who
w
```

## Systemd Services

Systemd is the init system and service manager for most modern Linux distributions. It controls which services start at boot, manages their lifecycle, handles dependencies between services, and provides logging through journald. Whether you are running a web server, database, or custom application daemon, systemd is how you manage it in production.

### Service management

```bash
# Start a service
sudo systemctl start nginx

# Stop a service
sudo systemctl stop nginx

# Restart a service
sudo systemctl restart nginx

# Reload configuration without restarting
sudo systemctl reload nginx

# View service status
systemctl status nginx

# Enable a service to start at boot
sudo systemctl enable nginx

# Disable a service from starting at boot
sudo systemctl disable nginx

# Check if a service is enabled
systemctl is-enabled nginx

# Check if a service is active
systemctl is-active nginx

# List all running services
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running

# List all failed services
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=failed
```

### Journal logs

```bash
# View logs for a specific service
journalctl -u nginx

# Follow logs in real-time
journalctl -u nginx -f

# View logs since last boot
journalctl -b

# View logs from the last hour
journalctl --since "1 hour ago"

# View logs between specific times
journalctl --since "2026-02-10 08:00" --until "2026-02-10 12:00"

# View kernel logs
journalctl -k

# Check disk usage by journal logs
journalctl --disk-usage

# Clean old journal logs (keep last 500MB)
sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=500M
```

### Create a custom service

```bash
# Create a service file for a custom application
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service << 'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=My Application
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=deploy
WorkingDirectory=/opt/myapp
ExecStart=/opt/myapp/bin/server
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

# Reload systemd after creating/modifying a service file
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Start and enable the new service
sudo systemctl enable --now myapp
```

## Process Control

Processes are the running instances of programs on your system. Monitoring and controlling them is essential for system stability — a runaway process can consume all CPU or memory, a zombie process can fill up the process table, and an unresponsive service needs to be identified and restarted. These commands give you the visibility and control to manage processes effectively.

### Monitor processes

```bash
# List all running processes
ps aux

# List processes in a tree format (show parent/child relationships)
ps auxf

# Interactive process monitor
top

# Enhanced interactive monitor (better UI)
htop

# Show top processes sorted by memory usage
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -20

# Show top processes sorted by CPU usage
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -20

# Find processes by name
pgrep -la nginx

# Find the PID of a specific process
pidof nginx
```

### Kill processes

```bash
# Send SIGTERM (graceful shutdown, signal 15)
kill <PID>

# Send SIGKILL (force kill, signal 9)
kill -9 <PID>

# Kill all processes by name
killall nginx

# Kill processes matching a pattern
pkill -f "python server.py"

# Send SIGHUP (reload configuration)
kill -HUP <PID>
```

### Resource monitoring

```bash
# Show memory usage summary
free -h

# Show disk usage
df -h

# Show disk usage for a specific directory
du -sh /var/log/

# Show top 10 largest directories
du -h /var/ --max-depth=1 | sort -rh | head -10

# Monitor disk I/O
iostat -x 1

# Monitor network connections
ss -tuln

# Show active network connections with process names
ss -tulnp

# Show system uptime and load average
uptime
```
