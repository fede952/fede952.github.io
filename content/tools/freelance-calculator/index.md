Setting the right hourly rate is the single most important financial decision a freelancer makes — yet most people just guess. Charge too little and you burn out chasing volume; charge too much and clients disappear. The math behind a sustainable rate is straightforward but rarely done: you need to reverse-engineer your **desired net income**, account for **self-employment taxes**, factor in **business expenses**, and divide by actual billable hours — not the 2,080-hour corporate year, but the realistic 1,200–1,400 hours most independents actually invoice.

RateMate does that calculation instantly. Enter your target annual take-home pay, adjust the tax slider for your bracket, input your monthly overhead (software, coworking, insurance), and set your realistic billable days and hours. The tool computes your **required hourly rate**, daily rate, and monthly gross income in real time. A live doughnut chart shows exactly where every dollar goes — net income, taxes, and expenses — so you can see the true cost of underpricing. Works with USD, EUR, and GBP. No signup, no data stored.
