Every photo you take with a smartphone or digital camera silently embeds metadata — camera model, date and time, software used, and often **your exact GPS coordinates**. When you share that image on forums, marketplaces, or messaging apps that don't strip metadata, anyone who downloads it can see exactly where and when you took it. That's a privacy risk most people never think about.

**EXIF Cleaner** reads and displays all embedded EXIF metadata entirely inside your browser, then lets you purge it with one click. Drop an image, review the metadata table (with a red warning if GPS data is found), and hit **Purge Metadata & Download** to get a clean copy with all metadata removed. The image is redrawn onto a canvas — no server, no uploads, no data ever leaves your device.
