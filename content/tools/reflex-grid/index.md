Aiming skill is the single biggest differentiator in competitive FPS games, yet most players never train it deliberately. Studies on esports performance show that **systematic aim training can cut average reaction time by 15–25%** within weeks, translating directly into higher kill–death ratios and rank progression. The problem is that dedicated aim trainers are typically paid desktop apps with complex setups, leaving casual and mobile players behind.

ReflexGrid brings pro-level aim training to the browser. Click **Start Training** to begin a 60-second session where targets spawn at random positions across a heads-up-display grid. Each hit records your **reaction time in milliseconds**, while misses reduce your accuracy percentage — just like a real match. When the round ends you get a full performance breakdown: total targets hit, accuracy rate, average reaction time, and a **skill rank** from *Potato* to *Pro*. The entire session runs on HTML5 Canvas with Web Audio API sound effects, works on desktop and mobile, and requires zero installation.
