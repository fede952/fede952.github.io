**Glitch art** is a digital art movement that embraces visual artifacts — the kind of corruption you see when a JPEG fails to decode or a video stream drops frames. Techniques like **data moshing** (forcing inter-frame compression across unrelated images) and **pixel sorting** (rearranging pixels by brightness or hue) transform ordinary photographs into striking, otherworldly compositions. What was once considered a flaw is now an aesthetic choice used by artists, designers, and musicians worldwide.

GlitchForge puts these techniques in your browser. Upload any photo and manipulate it in real time using four independent controls: **Amount** adds contrast and digital noise, **RGB Shift** separates the red and blue channels to create chromatic aberration, **Scanlines** overlay a CRT monitor effect, and **Pixel Sort** drags pixels vertically based on luminance — the signature look of algorithmic glitch art. Everything runs on the Canvas API inside your browser; your images are never uploaded anywhere.
