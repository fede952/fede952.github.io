Every time you visit a website, your browser broadcasts a surprising amount of personal data — your **public IP address**, approximate physical location, operating system, GPU model, screen resolution, battery level, and even local network IPs through WebRTC leaks. Advertisers and trackers use these signals to build a **unique digital fingerprint** that can follow you across the web, even without cookies. Most people have no idea how much they're exposing simply by opening a browser tab.

NetGuard makes the invisible visible. Click **Run Privacy Scan** to launch a comprehensive audit of everything your browser is revealing right now. The tool fetches your public IP and geolocation, detects your hardware fingerprint (OS, browser, GPU renderer via WebGL), checks your **battery status** and connection speed, and runs a **WebRTC leak test** to see if your private IP addresses are exposed. Each data point is displayed on a hacker-style dashboard with a final **Privacy Score** from 0 to 100. Everything runs in your browser — no data is stored or sent to our servers.
