Research in cognitive science shows that moderate background noise — a phenomenon called **auditory masking** — can significantly improve concentration by suppressing distracting sounds in your environment. Consistent ambient textures like rain, brown noise, or coffee shop murmur create a stable sonic blanket that lets your brain filter out sudden interruptions such as conversations, notifications, or traffic. Studies published in the *Journal of Consumer Research* found that ambient noise at around 70 dB enhances creative thinking compared to silence.

This tool is designed to help you reach and sustain a **flow state** — the mental zone where you are fully immersed in your work. By combining customizable sound layers with the proven Pomodoro Technique (25-minute focused sprints), ZenFocus gives you everything you need to lock in, block out distractions, and do deep work. Adjust each channel to your preference, pick a preset, and start the timer.
