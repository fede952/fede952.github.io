Large images slow down websites, eat up storage, and waste bandwidth. Most online compressors force you to upload your files to a remote server — meaning a stranger's machine processes your personal photos, screenshots, and documents. That's an unnecessary privacy risk for a task your own browser can handle locally.

**PixelShrink** compresses PNG, JPG, and WebP images entirely inside your browser using the [browser-image-compression](https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo/browser-image-compression) library. No file ever leaves your device. Drag and drop an image, adjust the **quality slider** (0–100), pick an optional output format (WebP or JPEG), and hit **Compress**. You'll instantly see the original size vs. compressed size and the percentage saved. One click to download the result — done.
