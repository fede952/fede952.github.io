### The Bridge Between Steel and Silicon
I am a **Security Developer** and **Red Team Aspirant** with a distinctive edge: I don't just understand networks; I understand the physical machines they control

Before transitioning to Cybersecurity, I spent **over 10 years in the Industrial Sector**, including 7 years as a specialized **CNC Programmer**.
Writing code for Fanuc and Selca systems instilled in me a strict procedural mindset: in that world, a syntax error doesn't just crash an app-it causes physical damage

**I bring that "Zero-Error" precision to Cybersecurity.**

Currently, as a **SOC Analyst**, I analyze live attack vectors to deconstruct how breaches happen
However, my trajectory is firmly set on **Offensive Security**: leverage my coding skills to build custom tools, automate reconnaissance, and simulate sophisticated threats

### Why My Background Matters
* **The "OT" Advantage:** The gap between IT and OT (Operational Technology) is a major security blind spot
* I speak the language of PLCs and industrial controllers, a critical asset for **ICS/SCADA Security**
* **Low-Level Logic:** My experience with G-Code (machine language) translates naturally to understanding **Assembly and Shellcode**
* I construct logic from the ground up
* **The Builder's Mindset:** I don't just run scripts; I build them
* I utilize **Python, SQL, and Bash** to create tailored automation tools rather than relying solely on off-the-shelf solutions

### Tech Stack & Arsenal

**🛡️ Offensive & Security**
* **Certifications:** eJPT (Junior Penetration Tester), Cisco Ethical Hacker, ISC2 CC, Google Cybersecurity
* **Arsenal:** Metasploit, Burp Suite, Wireshark, Nmap, Nessus
* **Focus:** Network Enumeration, Active Directory Exploitation, Web App Pentesting

**⚙️ Industrial & Core Logic**
* **Systems:** Fanuc, Selca (7 Years Exp.), Industrial IoT protocols
* **Skills:** G-Code Programming, Hardware Debugging, Process Logic Analysis

**💻 Development**
* **Languages:** Python (Automation/Tooling), SQL, Bash, PowerShell
* **Environment:** Linux (Kali/Debian), GitHub, Docker, Retool
